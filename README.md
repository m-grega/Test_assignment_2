# Test_assignment_2
An A/B test was conducted, in which the cost of a premium subscription was changed for new users of a dating application from several countries (money for the subscription is debited monthly until the user cancels it) when purchasing through two new payment systems. However, the cost of the trial period remained the same.
It was necessary to check:
1. Was the experiment successful overall?
2. Analyze whether the innovation makes sense among any specific user groups.
